- Automated testing suite (unit, integration, code quality)
- Secure deployment automation via SSH
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Rollback mechanisms
- Environment-specific configurations
- Security scanning
- Automated backup and recovery
- Comprehensive documentation
